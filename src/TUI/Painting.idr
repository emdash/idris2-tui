||| Immediate-mode TUI graphics.
|||
||| These routines are slightly higher-level than that provided by
||| `Control.ANSI`. In particular, we use types from `TUI.Geometry`.
|||
||| These routines operate on an opaque `Context` which theoretically
||| tracks the draw state, allowing for scope-based mangement of draw
||| state (position, color, font, style, etc). In practice everything
||| is written directly to stdout. Baby steps.
|||
||| I would like to support client code which looks like:
|||
||| ```idris
||| withSGR [Reverse] $ do
|||    window <- packTop state window self.label
|||    withClip window $ do
|||      withTransform self.scrollPos $ \window => do
|||        ignore $ paintVertical state window self.items
|||      ...
||| ```
|||
||| In certain situations, the rightward drift is a small price to pay
||| for clear scoping of draw operations.
|||
||| There is no support for *clipping*, and so there's no support for
||| scrolling. It's still early days.

namespace Context
  ||| A context for drawing to the terminal.
  |||
  ||| For now this is a simple wrapper around IO, which affords the
  ||| freedom to do something different later if need be.
  export
  record Context a where
    constructor C
    action : IO a

  ||| Context is just a wrapper around IO.
  |||
  ||| This escape hatch is to cover the cases we don't handle yet, in
  ||| a way that's easy to grep for.
  |||
  ||| The eventual goal is to remove all uses of this function, making
  ||| Context completely self-contained.
